# RADDI514_Image-Processing

This repository contains code and resources for image processing tasks, primarily developed for the RADDI514 course. It includes implementations of various image processing techniques using traditional and ML Python libraries such as Tensorflow (via Keras).

## Features

- Image loading, saving, and visualization
- Common preprocessing techniques (e.g., filtering, normalization)
- Edge detection and segmentation algorithms
- Morphological operations
- Example scripts and sample datasets
